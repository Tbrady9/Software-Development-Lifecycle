# Software-Development-Lifecycle

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
User needs are first discussed throughout the team. This is the opportunity to gain knowledge on things like requirements, format, layouts and whatever other details may be needed. This can all be documented using a software requirement specification sheet. User stories are a great way to formalize the requirements within the team so that all needs are clearly organized and communicated.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
Development can take different forms using different methods. The waterfall method is one in which all phases are clearly defined and do not overlap. For example, testing would take place after development. In contrast, the Agile method includes more flexibility and includes overlaping phases like testing concurrently with development. The most useful tool of Agile, in my opinion, is the scrum. This quick meeting is a way to keep everyone on the same page and briefly talk through issues. This would help development tremendously. As a developer, working side-by-side with the tester is also important. Testing can take place at the same time as development and issues can be caught and corrected in a timely manner.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Being a good team member in software development as well as anything else can be summed up as being respectful. Be respectful of people's time, the effort that they are putting into the project, and their thoughts. Listen to others and provide constructive feedback. Document and communicate clearly to do your best to give everyone else on the team as much of an advantage as possible.
